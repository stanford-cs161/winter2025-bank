    \section{Comparison Based Sorting Lowerbound} 
    Assume you have a function called 3-sort that takes as input an array of size 3 of comparable objects and returns them in 
    sorted order. You want to sort an array of size $n >= 3$ objects only using calls to 3-sort, How many function calls of 3-sort are
     required to sort an array of size n? 
    \Choices {
        \Choice{$\Omega(log(n))$}
        \Choice{$\Omega(\sqrt(n))$}
        \Choice{$\Omega(n)$}
        \Choice*{$\Omega(nlogn)$}
    }
    %-----
    Is it possible to implement the following algorithms or data structures in real life? \\
    \\
   %----
   A data structure that you can insert comparable objects in $O(1)$ operations, remove them in $O(1)$ operations, and make function calls to a function that returns the smallest object in the data stucture in $O(1)$? 
   
   \Choices {
       \Choice{Possible}
       \Choice*{Impossible}
   }
   %-----
    An algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ and takes and array A of size n of comparable objects, $i$, and $j$ ($i < j$) as inputs and returns all the elements that are greater than the $ith$ element in A and less than the $jth$ element in A ? 
    \Choices {
        \Choice*{Possible}
        \Choice{Impossible}
    }
    Which algorithm would be a good choice to use for the last part? 
    \Choices{
        \Choice*{k-select}
        \Choice{Radix Sort}
        \Choice{QuickSort}
        \Choice{MergeSort}
    }
    %------
    An algorithm that runs in $\Theta(n)$ and takes an array A of size n of comparable objects and partitions A into 
    $\frac{n}{log(n)}$ groups of size  $log(n)$ where for every $i<j$ members of group $i$ are smaller than or equal to members of group $j$. 
    \Choices {
        \Choice{Possible}
        \Choice*{Impossible}
    }

    \section{Radix Sort and Counting Sort}

    Assume you have an array A of size n with positive integer element with all elements in range of $[1, n^3)$. \\
    What is the runtime of Counting sort run on A? 
    \Choices {
        \Choice{$\Theta(n)$}
        \Choice{$\Theta(nlogn)$}
        \Choice{$\Theta(n^2)$}
        \Choice*{$\Theta(n^3)$}
    }
    What is the runtime of Radix sort, base $10$,  run on A? 
    \Choices {
        \Choice{$\Theta(n)$}
        \Choice*{$\Theta(nlogn)$}
        \Choice{$\Theta(n^2)$}
        \Choice{$\Theta(n^3)$}
    }
    Which base for Radix sort will result in the fastest Radix sort algorithm to sort A with? 
    \Choices {
        \Choice{$2$}
        \Choice{$10$}
        \Choice*{$n$}
        \Choice{$n^2$}
    }
