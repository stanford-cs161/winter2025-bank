	Suppose that the nodes $A, B, C$ in a binary search tree are arranged as follows.
	\Tikz*[every node/.style={shape=rectangle, rounded corners, align=center, draw=Black, line width=1}, line width=1]{
		\node {$A$}
			child { node {$B$} }
			child { node {$C$} };
	}
	Which of the following describes the relationship between $A, B, C$?
	\Choices{
		\Choice{$A\leq B, C$}
		\Choice{$A\geq B, C$}
		\Choice{$A\leq B\leq C$}
		\Choice*{$B\leq A\leq C$}
	}
	Now suppose that nodes $A, B, C$ are arranged as follows in the binary search tree.
	\Tikz*[every node/.style={shape=rectangle, rounded corners, align=center, draw=Black, line width=1}, line width=1]{
		\node {$A$}
			child {
				node {$B$}
					child[missing] {}

	What is the relationship between $A, B, C$?
	\Choices{

	\section{Red-Black Trees}
	Is the following a valid red-black tree? We are not drawing the implicit NIL nodes.

		\Choice*{No}
	}

	Suppose that $r$ is the root of a red-black tree on $n$ nodes. Assume all nodes have distinct values. If we sort the values stored in the tree to get $x_1< x_2< \dots < x_n$, and find the index $i$ where $r=x_i$, what can be said about $i$?
